            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Truly Deare Sir, I haue endeauored in dreſsing this meate, to prouoke your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. <hi>(Gen. 27.9.)</hi> and laboured, to ſett forth this doctrine in ſuch a stile, that it may moue you, diligently to read the ſame, which if you doe, I hope by the grace of God, you shall finde that wonderfull chaung in your ſoule, which others in former ages most happilie haue had, and as that, allmost euery day haue, who by the means of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bookes, haue vtterly detested their former licentious liues, and with great feruour and zeale, begunne anew in Gods holie ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Call to minde the treaſurer of the Queene of Aethiopia, who was reading I ſay the Prophet in his chariot, when God almightie conuerted him, by Saint Philip; <hi>(Act. 8.30.)</hi> Remember like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that thoſe ſoe notable, and famous <pb n="7" facs="tcp:15556:4"/> workes, which King Ioſias did in all his kingdome, proceeded from the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of an holie booke, which Helchias the Prophet, gaue vnto Saphan the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be. <hi>(4.

            <p>Is it not a moſt lamentable caſe, that men who profeſſe themſelues to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, should haue a greater care of their worldlie pelfe, honours, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, then of the health, and ſaluation of their owne ſoules?

Shall the bleſſed Apoſtle S. Paul. <hi>(Phil. 3.8.)</hi> count all thinges detriment, and esteeme them as dunge, that he might gaine Chriſt? And shall we like children be delighted with toyes, and with Eſops cocke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a barlie corne, before a rich gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me? shall we diſſemble with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences for the worlde, for feare that otherwiſe we should looſe our credit? Woe be vnto vs if we doe ſo, ſeeing our Bleſſed Sauiour hath ſayed. <hi>(Math.

Iohn Baptiſt, when he was in the wilderneſſe, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his commiſsion, and embaſsage was to preach pennance vnto the world, how that the axe was now layed to the roote of the tree; and euerie tree that bringeth not forth good fruite, to bee cut downe, and caſt into the fire; And that his life might bee conformable to his wordes; he executed in pennance the greateſt auſterities, his meat was locuſt, and wilde honie, the food which hee found in the fieldes, his apparell a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of camels hayre, girt with a rough girdle, and his chamber and lodginge, a caue of ſome craggic rocke, his boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and bedde the hard ground, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe with great patience, the colde, heate, hunger, and thirst, and other common iniuries of the ayre: But why <pb n="14" facs="tcp:15556:8"/> did this bleſſed and glorious forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Sauiour Chriſt endure all this? not in punishment of his ſinnes, hee beinge ſanctified from his Mothers wombe, but to preſerue himſelfe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, euen from the least offences, to tame his flesh, and bring it in ſubiection to the ſpirit, and to diſpoſe him ſelfe the better to receaue the guifts of heauen, which are not ordinarilie obtayned, but by ſuch painfull auſterities.</p>
            <p>Why then should not wee imitate this Saint and conforme our ſelues vnto him, wherein hee is imitable? Why should not wee embrace corporall auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, as much as wee may, chastiſing our flesh, and offeringe it as a liuelie hoste, holy and acceptable vnto God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in ſatisfaction for our ſinnefull liues past? <hi>(Rom. 12.)</hi> This path haue all theſe holie and iuſt men of the old and new testament formerly trodden; For in the written law the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, how they went in sheeps skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:15556:8"/> in goates skinnes, wandring in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, in mountaines, in dennes, and caues of the earth: and in the law of grace, wee plainlie ſee, that the whole life of our Bleſſed Sauiour, the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mirrour of all virtues, was nothing elſe but a continuall acte of penaunce, ſpent wholy in watching, praying, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, hunger, thirſt, and colde, with other like neceſsities wherunto we are ſubiect, ſuffering shamefull ignominies, and reproaches, and all for our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as witneſse his owne wordes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Ego dedi &amp;c. (Ioan. 13.15.)</hi> I haue giuen you example, as I haue done ſo do you likewiſe: His prayers were ſo long, that S.

<hi>(Marc. 13.33.)</hi> Take heed, <pb n="16" facs="tcp:15556:9"/> watch, and pray, and againe, watch yee therefore, for yee know not the houre in which the Lord of the houſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth.

And ſince their time, all theſe which haue ſafely paſſed the troubleſom ſea of this miſerable world, and are now arriued at the thriſe happy hauen of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicitie, they haue all done the like; To auoid prolixity, I referre you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to infinite exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in Egiſippus &amp; Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius and others; that haue written the liues of Saints in thoſe ages, as alſo in S.

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:15556:10"/>Is it poſsible then, that wee, knowing and hearinge theſe thinges, should, as holy Iob ſayeth, drinke vp ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, as beasts doe water? where are our witts, reaſon, and iudgement? when we heare Christ ſaying. <hi>(Mat. 16.26.)</hi> what doth it profit a man, if he gaine the whole world, and ſuffer detriment of his ſoule? And we like swine, wallow our ſelues in the filth, puddle, &amp; ſincke of all iniquitie? shall we be kindlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to the mariage dinner. <hi>(Math. 22.4.)</hi> and refuſe to come, for ſome baſe commoditie, that is complacent vnto our ſenſualitie? Certainly ſuch proceeding would argue want of faith in vs, that we should not beleeue, that the diuine iustice will punish ſinne, with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bannishment, out of the celestiall paradiſe of endleſſe bliſſe, and with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting paines and torments, in the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fire of hell.</p>
            <p>Let vs then (as the Apostle aduiſeth) <hi>(Heb. 12.12.)</hi> shake off from vs, all <pb n="19" facs="tcp:15556:10"/> weight and clogg that may hinder vs, let vs by patience and long animitie, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and make hast vnto the combat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto vs, with our eyes fixed vppon the authour of our faith, and principall cauſe therof Chriſt Ieſus, who ſetting before him the ioyes of heauen, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning the confuſion (or worldly shame that thereof might enſue) ſustained the bitter death of the Croſſe, and thereby hath obtained to ſitt at the right hand of the ſeat of God his Father.</p>

There are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in holy ſcripture, which doe liuely ſet before our eyes, the rigorous and ſoden execution of the iudgement, and ſeueritie of God vpon ſinners: The Iſraeliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call people ſinned, adoring the golden Calfe, preſently the fire of Gods wrath was kindled, and he ſaid vnto Moyſes. <hi>Dimitte me, ut <pb n="93" facs="tcp:15556:52"/> iraſcatur furor meus contra eos.</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.20.) ſuffer, mee that my fury may ariſe againſt them.

<hi>Et exurge à mortuis,</hi> and ariſe from the dead; Beholde a greater danger, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoule is endamaged by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? for after that a ſoule for ſome time hath ſlept in ſinne, it is more negligent in the exerciſe of good workes, and is ſo dulled, and in diſpoſed, that it ſeemeth <pb n="114" facs="tcp:15556:63"/> to be dead: For as the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſoule is dead: ſo a ſoule is dead without God; as the ſoule is the life of the body, ſo God is the life of the ſoule: know yee (deare Brethren) that there is noe dead carcaſe ſo ſtinkinge, or hath a more loathſome ſmell in the ſenſe of man, as a ſoule dead in ſinne hath, in the noſtrills of almighty God. There is an example at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the liues of the holy Fathers, of an Angell that did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie an Anachoret, to make him vnderſtand ſomething of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iudgements: Theſe in the way as they iournied, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a dead body, the Angel paſſing by, made noe ſigne of any offenſiue ſmell, but proceeding further, they met with a certaine comely yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man, richly inueſted, &amp; bearing about him ſtrong parfumes, at the ſight of whome, the Angell forthwith <pb n="115" facs="tcp:15556:63"/> ſtopped his noſtrills, at which thing the Anchoret wonderinge, he demaunded the reaſon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould ſtoppe his noſe, at that comely yong man, wel cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and ſending forth accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſmells, and immmediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, made no ſuch ſigne at the dead body: becauſe ſaid the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, youth loaden with ſinne ſtinketh more odiouſly, then a putrified body: <hi>I am fetet,</hi> now he ſtinketh ſaith Martha of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lazarus, (<hi>Ioan.</hi> 11.39.) oh my my Brother ſinner how grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doeſt thou ſtinke in the noſtrils of God, the Angels, &amp; the Saints in heauen?</p>

Oh ſinner, perſecutor of Ieſus Chriſt, I would to God, thou couldeſt ſee with what great ſcales, thy eyes are couered, which doe hinder, &amp; blinde thy ſight: <hi>Oculos ſuos ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerunt declinare in terram.</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.) they haue determined to decline their eyes towardes the earth: ſinners haue made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the diuell, to haue their eyes alwaies faſtned vppon the earth.</p>
               <p>Oh blinded ſinners, that Ieſus might illuminate your eyes, he would permit his diuine eyes to be ridiculouſly couered, &amp; ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <pb n="117" facs="tcp:15556:64"/> blindfolded: How ignorant, and blind art thou, oh ambitious man, which doeſt ſo ſtedfaſtly fix thine eyes vpon the vaniſhinge ſhadow of vaine glory?

Gregorie: I am not determined at this preſent to ſpeake of the great loſſe, which ſinne bringeth vpon the ſoule in the life to come,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15556:65"/> ſeeing that I purpoſe hereafter to take a more oportune occaſion, but now I wll intimate only, what, and how great a thing it is, that a ſoule looſeth by ſinne in this life: <hi>In maleuolam animam non intrabit ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia,</hi> wiſedome ſhall not enter into a malignant ſoule, ſaieth the ſcripture. (<hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1.4.) behold, the firſt ſhipwracke of a ſinnefull ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, is the want of the taſte of true knowledge, for although a ſinful ſoule is endued with an excellent vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, yet is it depriued of the comfortable taſt of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and neuer hath the guſt of the ſweetnes thereof. But this is nothing in reſpect of that which it looſeth, for the ſoule of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is depriued of the friendſhip, and amitie of God, which farre exceedeth all other thinges.</p>
               <p>Be wife now therefore, oh yee ſinners, and know how pretious a

13.11.) God ſpake vnto Moyſes, face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to his friend: and Ieſus Chriſt ſaieth to his diſciples. <hi>Iam non dicam vos ſeruos.</hi> (<hi>Ioan.</hi> 15.15.) now I will call you no more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, for the ſeruant knoweth not the minde of his Maſter, but you haue I called friends, becauſe whatſoeuer I haue heard of my Father, that I haue manifeſted vnto you: Behold by what meanes <pb n="121" facs="tcp:15556:66"/> a ſoule is made a friend and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God? to witt, by obeying his holy will, and obſeruing his diuine precepts; now a ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to doe that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies commaunded by God, and in neglect of this, &amp; performing the contrarie, he witneſſeth his malice, and contempt of ſo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and infinite a maieſtie: if God ſaieth vnto him, <hi>Non aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes nome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Domini tus in vanum.</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7.) thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, he is preſently breathing forth blaſphemies: If God ſaieth, <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua diem Sabath,</hi> keepe holy the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, he will little eſteeme the prophanation of it: if God ſaieth, <hi>Honora Patrem,</hi> honour thy Father, and thy Mother, he will be diſobedient to them: hence therfore ariſeth a capitall emni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betwixt the ſoule &amp; God, <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitates

83.4.) Our Lord will giue grace and glorie: That I may comprehend the matter in few wordes, our Lord is he that in this life, giueth grace, and in the next, glorie: But you, ſo long as yee are in mortall ſinne, are depriued of that grace, and dying in ſinne, ſhall neuer attaine to that glory (which God forbid:) therefore rather turne from your wicked wayes, and learne to liue vnto God, for our Lord ſaieth: <hi>Nolo mortem peccatoris impij &amp;c.</hi> (<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech.</hi> 33.11.) I will not the death of a wicked ſinner, but had rather that the vniuſt man would leaue <pb n="128" facs="tcp:15556:71"/> his iniquitie and liue. Therefore Brethren, conſider I beſeech you, the exceedinge great detriment and loſſe, that you ſuffer by the depriuation of grace: which that with fruite, and profit, I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, &amp; demonſtrate vnto you, I beſeech you, and implore this thing of you, that you would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely heare and with diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce read this that followeth.</p>
               <p>I haue formerly declared, how a ſinner looſeth the friendſhip of God, and now my intent is to make knowne vnto you, how he looſeth his diuine grace, which grace is as it were, an intermediat thing betwixt the ſoule and God, cauſing it to be acceptable, and gratefull vnto him: for the grace of God is no other thing, then a certaine ornament, garment, or ſpirituall veſtment of the ſoule, by which ſhe is made glorious &amp; <pb n="129" facs="tcp:15556:71"/> appeareth beautifull in the eyes and preſence of her beloued ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Chriſt Ieſus. Queene Heſter when ſhe would preſent her ſelfe vnto the King her husband, the ſcripture ſaieth.
<hi>Circundata est glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ ſuâ.</hi> (<hi>Eſter.</hi> 15.4.) ſhe was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all her glory, that ſhee might find fauour in the fight of the King her ſpouſe: So likewiſe a ſoule, that it may become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, in the diuine eyes of the King of heauen and earth, had neede be adorned with that rich garment of diuerſe colours. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.) which is the varietie of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts, and graces.</p>
               <p>But before I ſhall declare what this grace is, it will be needfull to ſpeake of the common diuiſion of grace, which all Doctors affirme, ſaying, that grace is two folde. The one is, <hi>Gratia gratis data,</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce giuen gratis, and for no prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <pb n="130" facs="tcp:15556:72"/> merit: the other, <hi>Gratum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens,</hi> making the party accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vpon whom it is beſtowed. Graces of the firſt ſorte, are the fouours, and ſpiritual gifts which are beſtowed vpon men, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, when be he ſaieth, <hi>Alij quidem per ſpiritum da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſermo ſapientia &amp;c.</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8.) to one is giuen by the ſpirit, the word of wiſedome, to another the worde of knowledge, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the grace of doing cures, to another the working of miracles, to another, prophecy, to another, the diſcerning of ſpirits, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other diuerſitie of tounges, to another interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and all theſe, worketh one, and the ſame ſpirit, diuiding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery one, according as he wil: Grace of the other kind, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpirituall qualitie, created of God alone, and infuſed into <pb n="131" facs="tcp:15556:72"/> the ſoule, which filleth and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth her eſſence: as the ſubtile Scotus affirmeth, afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth into the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as the angelicall Doctor teacheth: It is not our purpoſe to diſpute of this matter, it will be ſufficient for you to know, what you looſe by your ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Now the grace of God being thus vnderſtood, that it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpirituall qualitie created, and infuſed into the ſoule, which of its owne nature, is oppoſite to mortall ſinne, in ſo much that grace by no means, can ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with mortall ſinne, I ſay mortall ſinne: for grace is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by veniall ſinne, although a ſoule ſhould be blemiſhed with a thouſand venial ſinnes, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge it might obtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Behold now (Brethren) your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite detriment, penetrate your great loſſe, ponder well with your ſelues, in what a ſtate you are, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you are hatefull to almightie God: It is no ſmall thinge to be

Oh yee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, how fearfull is the ſound of this third Trumpet? It ſeemeth like vnto the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of thoſe trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, which at the laſte leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, a fearfull, broken, and terrible note: Oh how horrid, and vnpleaſant is it? giue eare; The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die. Oh fearful ſentence: but who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth it? the holy ſcripture, the miſtreſſe of truth, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God the Father, the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and the holy Ghoſt. But that you may with more attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, giue eare to the ſound of this trumpet, know yee, that ſo ſoone as yee commit mortall ſinne, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie of heauen, by the mouth of the moſte holy and bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, your ſentence is denounced in theſe wordes. Let this ſoule be accurſed, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:15556:75"/> and adiudged to death, that ſhee may be tormented, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the euerlaſting flames of hell fire, in the companie of vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glie and terrible diuels, in that deteſtable &amp; odious place of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; And then all hope and means being taken away of euer returning, if ſhee die in this ſtate, without penance, contrition, and it may be confeſſion, ſhe is giuen into the hands, and authoritie of diabolicall, and helliſh furies, for euer to be conſumed in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming flames. Oh that fearfull and moſte terrible ſentence, yet moſte right and iuſt!</p>
               <p>But giue eare a little further, oh you ſinners, for euery mortall ſinne that you commit, the ſame ſentence, in the ſame heauen, of the ſame God, Father, Sonne, &amp; holy Ghoſt, in the preſence of the B.

Oh deare Brethren, take this councell of mee, turne vnto almightie God, neither be diffident, or call into doubt, the diuine clemencie, and mercie, for though you were ten thouſand ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by ſentence condemned vnto hell, notwithſtanding, ſo long as yee liue, you haue time to chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the ſentence: <hi>Si autem impius e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit penitentiam &amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Ezec</hi>
18.21.) if the ſinner do pennance for all his ſinnes, which he hath wrought, all his iniquities ſhall be done away which he hath committed, ſaith God by the mouth of his holy Prophet Ezechiel: thus thou ſeeſt, oh ſinnefull ſoule, that God can &amp; wil change his ſentence, if thou pleaſe to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thy wicked courſe <pb n="138" facs="tcp:15556:76"/> and vngodly maner of liuing.</p>

               <p>Therfore I beſeech you, and entreat you (deare Brethren ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) for Gods ſake, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and loue of him, that died for you, that you would leaue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; be conuerted vnto your clement Redeemer; not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to abuſe his mercies, but to giue his diuine maieſtie, infinite thankes, for his long ſuffering, &amp; expecting, euen vntill this inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of your amendment, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and who is alwaies prepared fatherly to receaue you, if euer by amendement of life you ſhall

               <p>Wherefore (Brethren ſinners) be now vigilant and carefull for your ſoules, begge at this inſtant with importunity, pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for your

               <p>Conſider therefore (ô ſinner) that if God would permit it, thou ſhouldeſt not liue one moment longer, wherby to offend him any more, becauſe all creatures would riſe vp in armes againſt thee, but he reſerueth this, vntill the laſt day of iudgement, although he permitted many particular ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to be reuenged, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, by diuerſe creatures, that hee might giue an example to <pb n="206" facs="tcp:15556:110"/> other offenders: God graunt that we may take example at ſuch, &amp; ſo ſoone as may be, amend our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and be in his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ſo great, that we may be no more enemies to him &amp; his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</p>

                  <hi>Of the dead body, and carcaſe of man, and of the miſerie of the ſame, after the ſeparation of the ſoule.</hi> THE XXII. CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANd it came to paſſe, that the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger dyed, and was carried by the Angels, into Abrahams boſome; and the rich man alſo died, and was buried in hell.</hi> (<hi>Luc.</hi> 16.22.) Doeſt thou heare (ô ſinner) whither the ſoule of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus the beggar was carried? and where the ſoule of the rich Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure was buried? The poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, by the handes of Angels, was placed in Abrahams boſome, a place of perpetuall reſt, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie: the rich man, was preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated into the infernall lake of hell, a place of weeping, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual miſery. Conſider now, that the ſame ſhall be fall thee, if thou <pb n="228" facs="tcp:15556:121"/> dieſt not in the fauour, and grace of almighty God: And dying in his fauour, hauing not ſatisfied for the temporall puniſhments, which thy ſinnes do deſerue, thou ſhalt be carried into purgatorie, and there remaine vntil thou haſt paied the laſt farthing; But if thou ſhalt be diſſolued, and die in the fauour of God, and haſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for thy temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou ſhalt be aſſumed with troupes of Angels, into heauen, there perpetually to enioy the heatificall viſion, and ineffable delightes of paradiſe: But if thou ſhalt depart without penance for thy ſinnes, without confeſſion, or at leaſt contrition, and deſire of confeſſion, and reconciliation, when thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt attaine to the acte of confeſſion, thy ſoule then, at the inſtant of her departure out of thy body, preſently being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15556:121"/> vpon, by a companie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, ſhal be thruſt into the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of perpetual darknes.</p>
               <p>Thinke now, ô miſerable, and vnhappy ſinner, of the miſery of the body, which ſhal be left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a ſoule, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which it recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued its forme, beauty, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and being depriued of this coniunction and vnion, it ſhall be deformed, loathſome, pale, and wanne: Thinke with thy ſelfe, it beganne to be filthy, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, euen then when it was firſt taken with a feauer, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumption, impoſtume, or any other diſeaſe, and from that time, to wax moſt filthy, &amp; loathſome: Thinke that it doth agonize and ſweat, euen vntill the departure of the ſoule, and continually doth excreate, &amp; ſpitt forth, fleam, and other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted filth, and in this ſtate, and condition, weeping, languiſheth, <pb n="230" facs="tcp:15556:122"/> and decayeth: conſider, that after the departure of the ſoule, the eyes will remaine diſtorted, thy teeth grinning, thy mouth, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and thy countenance which before was faire, beautifull and comely, ſhal afterwardes become moſt hideous, and fearfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould: conſider, what loathſome excrements it will caſt forth, and of the ſuddaine, moſte odiouſly will ſtink: <hi>I haue ſaid to rottenneſſe, thou arte my Father: my Mother, and ſister to the wormes.</hi> (<hi>Iob.</hi> 17.14.) O extreame folly of man, which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for nothing but to polliſh, nouriſh, adorne, and make much of this putrified fleſh, which (whether thou wilt or no) muſt bee eaten, and deuowred vpp by wormes!</p>
               <p>We read of a certaine philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that out of curioſity, did viſit the toombe of Alexander the <pb n="231" facs="tcp:15556:122"/> great, which beinge opened, he found it, ſtinking, filled, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with wormes, and two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, eating, &amp; tearing his eyes; whereupon he cried out, ſaying, O Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, how lately is it, ſince the world could not ſatisfie, and fill thy deſire, but now thou art conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with three cubits of earth, and a little toombe! Yeſterday, thou diddeſt triumph and boaſt of the number of thy ſubiects, &amp; dominions, to day thou art filled with filthines, &amp; wormes!

               <p>Alas (o you ſinners) and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially you, which are giuen to the <pb n="232" facs="tcp:15556:123"/> ſenſuall deſires, &amp; vnlawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh) ſet before your eyes, the laſt miſery of your dead, putrified, and corrupted bodies, goe, and conſider with your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, the miſery, and deformity of thoſe dead carcaſes, and perſwade your ſelues, that you muſt be like vnto them, and more abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it may bee: Behould ô you harlotts, how Queenes, Ladies, and Miſtreſſes doe die, ſee ô you ſinners, how Kings, Lords, and Maſters without exception, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: and conſider that the ſame, yee it may be, worſe ſhall befall you: Behould how men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are buried (ſinners, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots) behould I ſay, in what ſtate they are, which are now buried, &amp; what they were within theſe few dayes, and be you aſtoniſhed, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly perſwading your ſelues, that the ſame, it may be worſe,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15556:123"/> ſhall happen vnto you: And ſay to your ſelues, woe Alas to me miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: N. O wretched: G. O vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy: E.

Heare you, what the dead man ſaith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. <hi>To me yeſterday, to thee to day:</hi> woe vnto thee, which behouldeſt mee, ſaieth the dead man, to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that looketh on him.</p>
               <p>Behould (ô woman) the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this dead body, which in former times, was thy aſſociate: Behould the mouth, noſe, and countenance of it, contemplate the breaſts, and golden haires, of which ſhe did ſo greatly, as thou doeſt, at this preſent, boaſt and glory, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what an alteration there is.

(<hi>Ioan.</hi> 11.39.) O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, what ſmell can be compared to that of an humane dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe? To what end therfore, ſuch diligence? and ſuch curioſitie? to what end ſuch coſt? odors, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ornaments? To what end, ſo many delightes, pleaſures, fancies, or whatſoeuer may ſeeme delectable to ſoe corrupted, and deformed a bodie?
<hi>I haue ſeene the offenders, and haue pined away, becauſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15556:124"/> they haue not kept thy law, ſaieth the Prophet. Pſal.</hi> 118.</p>
               <p>O my Brethren and ſiſters ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, you compell me to pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with Dauid, for the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of griefe, when I conſider the opprobries, offences, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies whereby you offend your God, and the irrecuperable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dammage, which you procure vnto your owne ſoules: How long ſhall ſinners, o Lord, how long ſhall ſinners glory? they ſhall manifeſt, and declare their iniquitie: <hi>Let God ariſe, and let his enemies be diſperſed, and let them that hate him, flie from his face. As ſmoake vanisheth, let them vanish away, as wax melteth at the preſence of the fire, ſo let ſinners perish at the preſence of God, and let the iust make merrie, and reioyce in the ſight of God, and let them be delighted in mirth.</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.2.) <hi>Breake the arme of the ſinner, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, <pb n="236" facs="tcp:15556:125"/> his ſinne shall be ſought, and he shall not be found:</hi> ſaieth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Prophet. (<hi>Pſal.</hi>
10.15.) beinge moued with an infinite zeale of the honour of God, and ſaluation of ſoules.</p>
               <p>O good Lord, I am not Dauid, but of all ſinners the moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, of all heinous offendors the greateſt, of all wicked malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, the moſt pernitious: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ô my God, &amp; deare Ieſus, I am incited, and mooued, with ſuch a deſire of thine honor, &amp; the ſaluation of my poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that from the bowells of my harte, or rather of thine, I implore thy clemency and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in theſe wordes.
<hi>Haue mercie vpon vs ô Lord, haue mercie vpon vs, for wee are much filled with contempt, becauſe our ſoule is much filled, and is made a reproach to the wealthy, and deſpection to the proud.</hi> O God haue
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15556:125"/> mercie vpon vs, haue mercie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, for wee are all thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thy ſeruantes, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Remember, ſweete Ieſus, my deare Lord, that all poore miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners are thy creatures, thy ſeruantes, thy children, thy brothers, thy ſiſters, therfore my Ieſus, take compaſſion, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration vppon thy children, and bretheren, and ſhew mercie vpon thy daughters and ſiſters: wee doe confeſſe, and humblie acknowledge, that wee haue all offended thy diuine, and infinite maieſtie, wee doe all deſire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and to reforme our liues, and actions, wee doe confeſſe, ô my Lord Ieſu, that thine ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clemencie, &amp; benignitie hath beene wronged, and abuſed, by vs all; wee confeſſe our dullnes, and negligence, in cooperating with <pb n="238" facs="tcp:15556:126"/> the diuine concourſe of thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and laſt of all, we confeſſe, that in all thinges we haue bene moſt vnprofitable, negligent, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſeruants, and moſt vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of ſuch a clement, louing, and bountifull Father, Lord, and Maſter.</p>
               <p>And therfore we caſt our ſelues downe proſtrate at thy feet, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiuely imploringe thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that thou wouldeſt not haue reſpect vnto our iniquities, but vnto thy fatherly mercy, &amp; moſt gratious compaſſion. <hi>Euen as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath mercy vpon his ſonne, ſo God is mercifull vnto thoſe that feare him, becauſe he hath knowne our making; He hath remembred vs, becauſe we are but duſt.</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102 15.) Man is as the hay, his dayes decay, as the flower of the field: Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Ieſu, that thou art our Father: correct, and inſtruct vs, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:15556:126"/> as a Father, that we, being moued with thy ſo great, beniguity, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and charity, may fly and haue recourſe vnto thee, like good children, and abandoning all vices, may faithfully ſerue thee, and loue, honour, and obey thee, as our louing, clement, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and omnipotent Father, for euer, and euer, world without end,</p>

               <p>Time will not permit, or ſuffer me, ô ſinners, to inſiſt any longer vpon the improbous impietie of Antichriſt, neither did I at the firſt, intend it, but this, I ardently deſire, that you, conſidering the greatnes, and multitude of euille wherwith your ſoules are blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and deformed, may auoide them, with great deteſtation ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, and loath them: for what other cauſe is there, wherefore Antichriſt ſhould be ſo impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and ſo wicked, but ſinne?

               <p>To Chriſt therfore, o yee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to Ieſus Chriſt, o yee obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſoules, draw neare, and haue recourſe to him: God calleth you by my penne, by that liuely blood of Chriſt: O ſinners by the virtue, and force of the loue, and mercie <pb n="249" facs="tcp:15556:131"/> of God, I beſeech you, and ſpeake vnto you in theſe wordes: Come ô you ſinners, death draweth nere, but Ieſus Chriſt died for you, that you might liue for euer: Come ô you ſinners vnto Ieſus, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, is at hand to throw you into hell: Turne you to Chriſt, who calleth you, by the ſound of my Trumpet, leſt he reiect, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne you with the ſound of his ſeuere, and bitter ſentence at the day of iudgement.

                  <hi>Of the fearful ſignes which shall apeare before the day of iudgement: by the conſideration whereof, many ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoules may be ſaued, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might perish.</hi> THE XXIV. CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANd there shall be ſignes in the ſunne, and in the moone, and in the starres, in the earth distreſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the confuſed ſound of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the ſea, mens hartes fayling them for feare and expectation of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which shall come vpon the whole world.</hi> (<hi>Luc.</hi> 21.25.) And I wil make wonders in heauen and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of ſmoake, the ſunne ſhall be turned into darknes, and the moone into <pb n="151" facs="tcp:15556:132"/> blood, before the great, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day of the Lord doth come. (<hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.30.) O vnhappy ſinners, if you would but ſettle your cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations vpon theſe horrible thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and prodigious ſignes, I doe not doubt but that with feare and terrour, at the very conſideration of them, your ſtony hartes would cleaue a Sunder: What? when you ſhall ſee the ſunne obſcured, the moone turned into blood, the ſtarres obfuſcated, and ſeeming to fall from heauen, the earth to be moued and tremble, the ſea to rage, mountaines to breake, and fall a ſunder, and to be leuelled with the vallies, dumbe creatures ſo affrighted as to runne here and there; Lions to roare, Beares to make a hideous noiſe, Wolfes to houle, and other wilde beaſts, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to ſight, by the motion of the earth, to come out of theire
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:15556:133"/> dennes and caues, Dragons and Birdes to flie vp and downe the aire: who would not be aſtoniſhed for feare, and diſſolued with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?</p>
               <p>O humane miſerie, what ſhall be come of thee? What a terrour will it be, to ſee and heare in the fearfull day of iudgement, theſe ſtrange ſignes, and vnheard of wonders? <hi>And there shall be a great tribulation, ſuch, as was not ſince the beginning of the world, euen to this day,</hi> ſaieth our Lord by S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. (<hi>Math.</hi> 24.21.) I will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (ô ſinners) to ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pett in your eares, that I may rouſe you, out of the deepe ſleepe of your ſinnes, being moued with a vehement deſire of your ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and incited by the loue of my deare Sauiour Ieſus: woe bee vnto you, if you ſtoppe your ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res at the ſound thereof, but moſt <pb n="253" facs="tcp:15556:133"/> happy if you attend, and giue eare vnto it, which is ſent forth for the ſaluation of your poore, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoules. Many ſignes there are, which ſhall goe before the day of iudgement, but fifteene only are reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred by S. Hierom.</p>
               <p>The 1. ſigne is, that the ſea ſhall tranſcend the mountaines, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cubits. The 2. ſigne: the ſame ſea ſhal deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in ſuch a lowneſſe, as that it ſhall hardly be percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The 3. ſigne: All the vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, eſpecially they that liue in the ſea, ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together into lakes and pooles, there to lament their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. The 4. ſigne: The ſea, and all waters ſhall burne. The 5. ſigne: All trees and herbes ſhall droppe blood. The 6. ſigne: Al the foules of the ayre ſhall be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, ſending forth cries, and lamentations, and abſtaining <pb n="254" facs="tcp:15556:134"/> from their vſual meate &amp; drinke. The 7. ſigne: All houſes, &amp; ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie buildinges which are in the world, ſhall be ruinated to the ground. The 8. ſigne: Lightnings, and firie dartes, ſhall flie from the weſt towardes the eaſt, threatning the heauens, and ſtriking feare, and aſtoniſhment into the whole world. The 9. ſigne: The ſtones ſhall contend amongſt them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and in their conflict, ſhall be broken. The 10. ſigne: Earthqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes throughout all partes of the world ſhall be ſo great, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, nor beaſt ſhall be able to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on their feete. The 11. ſigne: All the mountaines ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into duſt. The 12. ſigne: All creatures ſhall leaue their caues &amp; dennes, and being poſſeſt with a kinde of madnes, ſhall wander abroad. The 13. ſigne, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the graues and toombes ſhall <pb n="255" facs="tcp:15556:134"/> be opened, and the bones of all the dead, ſhall ſtand vpright vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their graues. The 14. ſigne: The ſtarres ſhall fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The 15. ſigne: Euery thing that is endued with life, ſhall be chaunged, as well beaſts, as men, as vpon the ſuddaine; thoſe men that now dy, together with them, that haue died ſince the creation of the world, ſhall be reuiued and liue againe: Fearfull ſignes they be (ô ſinner) which I relate vnto thee, receaue them for thy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and enrich thy ſoule ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for thy ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſea ſhall tranſcend the mountaines, to contemne thy pride and inſolency (ô arrogant, and faſtidious wretch.)
<hi>The wicked are as a rageing ſea,</hi> ſaieth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. (<hi>Iſay.</hi> 57.20.) But the ſea ſhall aſcend in ſuch a height, as that it ſhall excell the mountaines, and <pb n="256" facs="tcp:15556:135"/> waſh away the arrogancy of the proud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſea ſhall be depreſſed to that lowneſſe, that it ſhall hardly apeare: wherby, ô proud wretch, it ſhal be declared vnto thee, that at laſt, thou muſt be depoſed, and plucked downe by God. <hi>Euery man that exalteth himſelfe,</hi> ſaieth our Lord, <hi>shall be humbled.</hi> (<hi>Luc.</hi> 14.) and humility, ſaieth the wiſeman, followeth the proud.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, which is the third ſigne, what ſhould it demonſtrate vnto thee (o ſinner) but that they, who haue taken much delight in vaine, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, and laſciuious complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſhall then be puniſhed, and tormented, with fearfull execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and vlulations: <hi>Speake vnto the earth, and it shall shew thee, and the fishes of the ſea, and they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto thee,</hi> ſaieth holy Ioh.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:15556:135"/>4. The fourth ſigne ſhall bee, that of the ſea and waters, in that they ſhall conſume with heate, which may inſtruct thee, ô luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinner: for euen as thou haſt burned in this world with the fire of filthy concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, luxurious deſires, and adulterous actions, euen ſo muſt thou burne in hell with fire, and brimſtone; <hi>their part shall be in fire and brimstone,</hi> ſaieth S. Iohn in his Apocalipſe. (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 21) and by this meanes, ſo much as thou haſt abounded in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious deſires of the fleſh, ſo much ſhalt thou receaue of this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this next world;
<hi>How much shee hath delighted her ſelfe in pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, ſo much punishment giue you vnto her,</hi> ſaieth the iudge in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calipſe
<hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What meaneth that ſweat of the herbes and trees, which is the fift ſigne? O wretch, that <pb n="258" facs="tcp:15556:136"/> blood, which thou haſt ſhed with thy cruell and vnmercifull han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: Becauſe that murder is one of thoſe capitall crimes which cry vnto heauen for reuenge:
<hi>The voice of thy brothers blood, crieth out of the earth to mee,</hi> ſaieth God to Cain.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That mourning and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie from meat and drinke of the birdes, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing (ô thou glutton) doth it ſignifie, then the paines &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſhall be inflicted vppon thee in hell, for thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy, and ebriety? for they that are giuen vnto this vice, ſhal be fedd in hell with hunger, and dearth; <hi>The portion of drunkards, shall be fire and brimstone, and the ſpirit of tempest, is parte of their chalice. Pſal.</hi> 10.7.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ruine and deſtruction of all buildings throughout the world, what elſe doth it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <pb n="259" facs="tcp:15556:136"/> but the folly and vanity of thoſe, which placed all their delight, and chiefeſt felicity, in building ſumptuous and ſpatious pallacies? Alas how many are there found of theſe times, which haue more reſpect of the houſes in which their bodies dwell for a time, then of heauen in which their ſoules ſhould perpetually remaine? <hi>woe be vnto you, which ioyne houſe to houſe, &amp; field to field:</hi> O miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches how much better would it be for you, if you would ſtudie to polliſh, and adorne the celeſtiall palaces of your ſoules for heauen, where there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie beautifull, and glorious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? <hi>In my Fathers houſe, there ar many manſions.</hi> (<hi>Ioan.</hi> 14.2.) ſaieth our Lord: O extreme vanitie, and madnes of the world!</p>
               <p n="8">8. What do thoſe flaming, and burning dartes, thoſe lighninges <pb n="260" facs="tcp:15556:137"/> running from eaſt to weſt, what, doe they ſignify, but the wrath &amp; indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the angry iudge againſt ſinners, and thoſe which haue moleſted or wronged their neighbours, or brothers? <hi>Euery man that is angry with his brother,</hi> ſaieth Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>shall be guilty of iudgement. Math.</hi> 5.22.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The conflict of the ſtones, ſignifieth your Adamantine, and obdurate hartes, which ſhall be broken a ſunder with the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, becauſe they are not mollified by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and ſpiritual thinges nothing profit you, the promiſes of Chriſt will not allure you, the fearfull iudgements of the latter day, the intollerable puniſhments of hell ſet before you, doe not any thing moue you: O ſinners more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then ſtones, the ſtones claue a ſunder at Chriſts paſſion, but <pb n="261" facs="tcp:15556:137"/> you more hard then they, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſtill in obduracie.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The great earthquakes (ô ſinner) which ſhall be ſo terrible, as that S. Iohn ſaieth in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calipſe; There is made a great earthquake, ſuch an one, as hath not beene ſince the beginning of the world; it ſignifieth this, that you cannot be ſuſtained any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the ſame, and therefore it trembleth, and ſhaketh, that it may ſwallow you vp: Or the earth (as S. Gregorie ſaieth) therefore quaketh, becauſe it will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ſinners any longer, before they haue heard the ſentence of the iudge, pronounced againſt their crimes, and offences: Alas into how great a ſtreight ſhal ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be brought? if they looke vp, they ſhal behould the angry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the iudge offended: if they looke downe, they ſhall ſee <pb n="262" facs="tcp:15556:138"/> hell gaping, prepared to receaue them: vpon their right hand, they ſhall behould their ſinnes &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes accuſing them: vpon the left hand, innumerable diuels in readines to carrie them into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtinge flames: Inwardly, the worme of the conſcience gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, outwardly the fire and torments ſcorch them, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. Which way then ſhall a ſinner flie or turne him ſelfe? then ſhall they cry out, <hi>O you mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fall vpon vs, and hide vs from the face of him that ſitteth vpon the throne, and from the wrath of the lambe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The leauellings of hils with vallies, what do you thinke it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies (ô ſinners) but the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of proud, great, and rich men, which haue trampled the poore and needy vnder their feet? and then all ſhall be made a like and equall, <hi>euery vally,</hi> ſaieth the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:15556:138"/> Prophet Iſay, <hi>shall be exalted, and euery mountaine, and hill, shall be brought low.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. All creatures ſhall forſake their caues and dennes, &amp; being poſſeſſed with a kinde of madnes, ſhall wander abroad: what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it, thinkeſt thou? nothing elſe, but that no ſecret corner, no excuſe ſhall be found of any: all ſuccour and releife ſhall bee taken away from poore ſinners, and no place or parte left, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be relieued. Not any Saint, not any Angell, not the B. V. Saint Mary Mother of God, ſhal aſſiſt them, becauſe God him ſelfe will be ſo exceedingly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them: Alas ô you wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and accurſed ſinners, what will you then doe? what will you ſay, ô miſerable ſoules? you ſhall walke, and wander here, &amp; there, outragious, madde, furious, not <pb n="264" facs="tcp:15556:139"/> knowing what to ſay, or what to doe. Now therfore, now I ſay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at this inſtant, whilſt it is time, doe that, which then (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſoules that you are) you ſhall not be able to doe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The graues ſhall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the dead bones ſtanding vpon them: which ſhall be the thirteenth ſigne. <hi>Behould I shall open your toumbes,</hi> ſaieth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezechiel: whereby it is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated vnto thee, o ſinner, that then all the filth and corruption of thy ſepulcher (to witt) of thy defiled, and polluted harte, ſhall be manifeſted, and brought to light. <hi>There is nothing hid, but it shall be reuealed, and nothing ſo ſecret, but shall apeare,</hi> ſaieth our Lord.

               <p n="14">14. <hi>The ſtarres shall fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> ſaieth our Lord: that it may ſtrike a feare, and terrour into all ſinners, which haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnworthy of that celeſtiall kingdome.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Laſt of all, all men ſhall be changed. To ſignifie vnto thee, o ſinner, that then all pleaſures muſt haue an end, and that thy ſelfe ſhalt ceaſe to offend, iniury, and wrong thy God, and deare Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude: noe man doth walke ſafe, amongſt Serpents, &amp; Scorpions: we are here, enuironed with troupes of enemies: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as often as I thinke, of the daunger of the time now preſent, and the fearfull ſignes of the time of the laſt iudgement, I cannot <pb n="266" facs="tcp:15556:140"/> but tremble, throughout all the partes of my body; for whether I eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer elſe I do, I thinke I alwaies heare that terrible trumpet ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in mine eares. <hi>Ariſe you dead and come to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement: for we must all be manifeſted before the tribunall ſeat of Christ, that euery one may receaue the proper thinges of his body, as he hath done, either good or euill.</hi> (<hi>S.

Alas ô you ſinners, what will you doe, at that time, when euen the dead in their graues ſhall heare this terrible ſound, ariſe you dead and come to iudgement? what will you doe, when the Angell ſhall gather you to iudgement? you cannot then withdraw your ſelues, or ſteale away: you cannot ſay, we wil not:

               <p>O what a glorious ſight will it bee, to behould, throughout the whole world, eſpeciallie at Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, ſo great a number of Saints bodies, ariſing in ſuch wonderful ſplendour, &amp; brightnes?

God will ſend in to the hartes of the damned a deſire, and wonderfull thirſt of thoſe things, wherof they cannot be partakers, he wil cauſe in them, that they ſhall know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the admirable good which is contained in him, and the great ſweetnes and delight, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation of his diuine maieſtie: they ſhall know that they haue loſt all theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by their ſinnes, hauing no hope at all, euer to enioy him; He ſhall make them vnderſtand, how the bleſſed liue in perpetual pleaſures which ſhall neuer faile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the damned ſhall frett, and pine away with griefe, they ſhall know how they might haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame if they had exerciſed them ſelues in vertuous actions, and had refrained from ſinner &amp; vices; wherupon they ſhall runne

               <p>O ſweetnes flowing from the diuine ſight! The holy Prophet, when in this life, he did but call to mind his God, languiſhed with a wonderfull kinde of ſweetnes, which thereby he did conceiue, <hi>Memor fui Dei, &amp;c.

Goe to now ſinner, call to thy remembrance thoſe grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in hell, vnleſſe thou amend thy life; And firſt of all conſider, that in hell, there is a wonderful denowring fire, euer burning, and yet neuer conſumeth thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable damned: <hi>Praeparata eſt ab heri: It is prepared ſince yeſterday,</hi> that is from the beginning of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <pb n="332" facs="tcp:15556:173"/> of the world, there is a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce prepared which is called To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which ſignifieth a miſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or beguiling, that is hell: whither all the ſoules miſled, and beguiled by the world, the fleſh, and the diuell, preſently reſorte.</p>
               <p>This Tophet, and this hel, God the King of Kinges hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to reuenge and puniſh thoſe execrable diuels, &amp; all ſinners to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Proſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>data &amp;c.</hi> It is deepe and vaſte: hell is large &amp; of great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe, ſaith the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet I ſay: <hi>Nutrimentum eius &amp;c.</hi> the fuell of this place is fire, &amp; wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God with his breath doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The holy Doctors doe hould, that this fire is corporall:
<hi>Ignem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernalem corporalem eſſe non ambigo,</hi> ſaieth Saint Gregorie.

<hi>Nutrimenta eius ignis, &amp;c.</hi> The nutriment therof is fire and much wood, neither ſhall there want, one daily to blow it, for the breath of our Lord, like a torrent of brimſtone doth kindle it: But you muſt by no means ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or thinke that there is wood in hell, neceſſary to encreaſe the fire: but the ſacred ſcripture, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſo, to this end, that it may be prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted more liuely vnto our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends, <pb n="335" facs="tcp:15556:174"/> and perceaueth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges; neither can wee but ſay, the diuells, and ſoules before iudgement, and the bodies of the damned after iudgement, be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by wood: for euen as the wood ſhall be caſt into the fire, ſo the diuels and the damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits before the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and their bodies after, ſhal be caſt into the ſame: O wonderfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, and calamitie, whereinto a ſinner falleth, ſeeing that he muſt go downe into hell, where he ſhal burne for euer and euer, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be conſumed!</p>

Although in hel, there is but one common fire to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the diuells, and damned ſoules, yet in diuerſe places, and partes of hell, there ſhall alſo be diuerſe fires, whereof ſome ſhall be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <pb n="347" facs="tcp:15556:180"/> then others, burning more, ſtinking worſe, that there, ſinners may be puniſhed, according to the diuerſitie of their offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: But let vs come now to the ſecond kinde of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Ponder with thy ſelfe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this fire, there is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full intenſe colde, which ſome ſhall feele more, ſome leſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they be loaden with the burden of their iniquities: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las you ſloathfull, ſluggiſh, and cold Chriſtians, in holy religion, and in God his diuine ſeruice, this extreame colde, theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable tortures, and torments, will he inflict vpon you; congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you like ice, and cauſing you to gnaſh with your teeth, as our Lord ſaieth, <hi>Ibi erit fletus, &amp; stridor dentium, there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third kind of puniſhment, <pb n="348" facs="tcp:15556:181"/> is, the vggly ſhape and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wormes which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually biting, and gnawing of you: <hi>vermis eorum non morietur:</hi> their their worme ſhall not die, ſaieth the Prophet Iſay. (<hi>Iſay.</hi> 66.24.)
<hi>Vindicta carnis impij, ignis &amp; vermis,</hi> the reuenge of the fleſh, of the wicked, is fire, and the worme, ſaieth the wiſe man. (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.19.) <hi>Dominus dabit vermes &amp; carnes eorum,</hi> the all powerfull Lord, ſaieth Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith, will giue wormes to their fleſh. (<hi>Iud.</hi> 16.21.) The more that ſinners haue delighted them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in foule, filthy, and enormous vices and crimes, the more ſhall they be tormented in hell, with ſtrange vggely monſters, of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, toades, dragons, and ſuch like, which indeed are nothing elſe but diuels, in the forme and ſhape of theſe liuing creatures, allthough ſome Doctours affirme <pb n="349" facs="tcp:15556:181"/> ſuch creatures to be really there, that the torments of the damned ſoules may be more cruell, and intollerable.</p>
               <p>Wo to thee then wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which placeſt thy felicitie, in carnall impuritie, thinke how thou ſhalt be often times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with ſerpents, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, toades, or other ſome vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely &amp; deformed creatures, worſe then the former, all which ſhall bite thee with their venemous teeth, and teare thoſe partes of thy body, wherein thou tookeſt greateſt pleaſure &amp; contentment, with incredible torture: O miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and calamitie! O thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of! yet for all this, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinner doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider them: The daintie damſell, and braue citizens wife, do not trouble their thoughts with theſe thinges: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las how many are there, which
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:15556:182"/> haue wholy giuen them ſelues to the ſinnefull luſts and ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes of the fleſh: and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they haue the leaſt thought of it, haue deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottomleſſe pit:
<hi>Ducunt in bonis, dies ſuos:</hi> they lead (ſaith ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Iob) their liues in good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but in an inſtant goe downe into hell: O the calamitie, of the blinde and fooliſh world, which after ſuch a manner, vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>The fourth puniſhment is, that intollerable ſtinch which ſhal fill the noſtrils of the damned, with ineffable vexation: This ſtinch, of the holy ſcripture is called. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſulphureus, a stinch mixt with brimſtone: ignis &amp; ſulphur &amp;c.</hi> Fire and brimſtone, and the blaſt of ſtormes, is the portion of their cupp, ſaith the pſalmiſt. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.7.) <hi>pars iniquorum &amp;c.</hi> the portion <pb n="351" facs="tcp:15556:182"/> of the wicked ſhall be in a lake, or poole burning with fire, &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: The reaſon wherefore the fire, the colde, and the ſtinch of hell, are ſo exceſſiue, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, is, becauſe they can neuer vent forth, but are ſhutt vp, &amp; kept cloſe within the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low partes of the earth; euen as fire in a furnace kept in on euery ſide, is of greater force to burne, then if it had compaſſe to dilate it ſelfe, that the flame and heat thereof might euaporate.</p>
               <p>Weigh the matter exactly, and conſider awhile, ſinner, what an ill ſauour thou ſhouldeſt ſmell, if thou wert ſhut vp cloſe in a ſinke, full of all filthines, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where no ayre can come in, in the which dead carcaſes lie, where pitch &amp; brimſtone is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Out of this gather, what ill ſauour thou ſhalt finde in hell,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:15556:183"/> where the damned bodies ſhall ſtinke farre worſe (without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon) then the carcaſes of dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or of any other filthy carrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: But contrariwiſe, the bodies of Gods ſeruants, and bleſſed in heauen, ſhal ſend forth, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euery part of the ſame, moſt delightſome ſauours. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, what a ſtinch, that will be of hell, where ſo many bodies of damned perſons, of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſhall be, not for one day, but for eternity: All the damned ſhall be there kept cloſe priſoners to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, one lying vpon another, and one infecting another with his ſtinch and loathſome ſauour. <hi>Sicut oues in inferno &amp;c.</hi> as ſheepe, they are put in hell, death ſhall feed vpon them, ſaieth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.15.</p>

               <p>Harken (ſinners) to a terrible example, which maketh for our purpoſe, and is related of Iohn Climachus, in the eight ſermon of his booke of ſermons, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie is thus: A certaine Monke called Stephen, dwelling in mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <pb n="383" facs="tcp:15556:200"/> Sinay, was wonderfully delighted with the tranquillity of a ſolitary life, who (as this authour repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) was adorned with rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, learning for many yeares together, to become a valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Ieſus Chriſt: This reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the day before he died, would ſome times looke on the right ſide, other times on the left ſide of his bed, as though there were ſome preſent, that demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a very ſtrict account of all the thinges which euer hee had done: We indeed, ſaw no body ſaieth he, to talke thus with him, yet ſometimes he would ſay, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſo it is, againe he would ſay, I graunt it, but this I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and for the ſame, I haue faſted, &amp; lamented ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a time: Another while, he would ſay, it is true, and preſently after, you belie mee, it is not ſo, I neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <pb n="384" facs="tcp:15556:201"/> any ſuch crime, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after, he would tell them, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, you accuſe me vniuſtly, and lay this infamy vndeſeruedly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mee; But this moſt of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed vs, when he ſayed, I yeeld, that it is true, neither doe I know what to replie, or anſwere for my ſelfe: yet I put my truſt in God who is mercifull: ſo that this obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure iudgement which none there preſent did vnderſtand, was moſt terrible to relate, but eſpecially in this, that the diuels ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of thinges which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did: O wretch, that I am, to what ſtreight was that Anachoret brought into, a true louer of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie, and an heremiticall life! who after that he had continued a monke for fourty yeares, and had ſhedd forth many profitable teares, yet after all this, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he could not ſay any <pb n="385" facs="tcp:15556:201"/> thing for him ſelfe, or giue a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient anſwer to excuſe his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Woe, woe then to vs: where was that large promiſe which all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God had made by the mouth of his holy Prophet Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiell? <hi>Si impius egerit paenitentiam.</hi> (<hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.27.) <hi>If the wicked shall doe pennance for all the ſinnes which he hath wrought; all his iniquities which he hath done, I will not remember:</hi> He could anſwere nothing, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge this in his behalfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, God is onely to be praiſed and extolled, who knoweth the cauſe and reaſon of all thinges: And ſo much the more, for that ſome monkes affirmed, that this Stephen ſo long as he liued in the deſert, fedd and nouriſhed a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard with his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: yet this Heremit, of ſuch fame, and note in the world, being called to giue an account of his life, left no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <pb n="386" facs="tcp:15556:202"/> behinde him, what ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce paſſed on him, whither he was accepted before God or no. This hiſtory Climachus relateth.</p>
               <p>Haue you giuen eare to this, ſinners? how is it then, that you liue ſo ſecurely, being contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with vices and loathſome ſinnes, ſuppoſing that you ſhall die well enough, when Alas you heare that ſo famous an Heremit, a man of ſuch notable ſanctitie, who did great pennance ful four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares, now dying, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwere, when a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to be made? O how nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſhall our life be diſcuſſed, and examined, when we ſhall be ſummoned by death, to appeare before the tribunall ſeate of all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, to render a ſtrict account of the ſame?</p>
               <p>We read in the Chronicles of our ſacred order, that when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <pb n="387" facs="tcp:15556:202"/> brother died, who had liued well, and deuoutly, and giuen good example to all the comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, a Doctor of diuinity beinge ſlacke in perfourming his office, which was, to ſay Maſſe for this dead brother, according to his obligation, thinking indeed, that ſeeing he had liued ſo vertuouſly, he did not ſtand in any need ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Hereupon, one day, betimes in the morning, this deceaſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, appeared vnto him, and ſayed. <hi>Salue Magister, vbi est illa cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, quâ te ſacrificium pro me factu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum promiſeras? God ſaue you Sir, what is become of your charitie, in that you promiſed to offer, the holy ſacrifice of the Maſſe for my ſoule?</hi> I thought (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the diuine) you had no need thereof; No need of it, ſaied the other? <hi>Vtinam ſcires quàm ſeueré ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotium in morte tranſigatur. I would to God thou knewest how ſeuerely our <pb n="388" facs="tcp:15556:203"/> buſines is handled after death?</hi> Know thou, that I am puniſhed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, with moſt grieuous pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and torments, for which if thou wilt offer this holy ſacrifice for me, forthwith I ſhal be freed: when he had ſayed this, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Doctor fulfilled his promiſe.</p>
               <p>Alas therfore ſinners, take heed what you doe, refraine from your miſchieuous acts, doe pennance for your former offences, delay not, diligently to caſte vp your account: Lord God almightie, cleaue in ſunder the ſtonie hartes of wandering ſinners, that thou mayeſt be worſhipped, and poore ſoules redeemed with thy moſte pretious bloud, may be ſaued: Take away Lord Ieſu, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſtroy the power of Sathan, which he ſo long hath exerciſed with all cruelty, againſt the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable

Alas what torments and paine will you haue to continue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in that infernall darke dungeon? Ponder that after death thou ſhalt be wholie in the diuels cuſtodie, where thou mayeſt bee ſure, that theſe deadly enemies of God, and of mankinde, will vſe all cruelty to afflict thee, which poſſibly they can deuiſe: When, I pray thee will the diuel beginne his dominion ouer thee, in reſpect of thy ſoule? In the very day of thy death, and departure out of this life: for ſo ſoone as thy ſoule ſhall leaue thy ſtinking and vile body, preſently will theſe cruell fiendes lay hold vpon her, and <pb n="391" facs="tcp:15556:204"/> entertaine her with ſtore of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Conſider with what fury, and madnes, they will take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of thy ſoule: Thinke what ſtraunge kindes of torments they will inuent to puniſh her? O there is nothing which we can excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſo horrible as this: Know for certaine, that after death &amp; iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, the diuell may diſpoſe of thee, as he liſteth, as well for thy body, as thy ſoule.</p>

Thou art deceaued wretch, if thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that thy body, which for ſo many yeares together, hath bene expoſed to al abhominable vices, ſhall not at laſt receaue recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for its former lewednes: <pb n="392" facs="tcp:15556:205"/> Thou greedy glutton which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure-like, makeſt a God of thy belly, doeſt thou not expect the wages which thou haſt deſerued?
